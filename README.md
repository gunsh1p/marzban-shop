#### Difference between host and global

There are two environment variables PANEL_HOST and PANEL_GLOBAL
PANEL_HOST - address of the panel for interaction with API. If the panel is on the same server as marzban-shop, then localhost should be specified as the address. For example, <http://localhost:8080>
PANEL_GLOBAL - address for issuing subscriptions. It is used for substitution of a link to the subscription. It should be accessible not only in the local network, but also outside it

#### About webhook

To receive responses from the Telegram server and payment provider servers, webhook is used. This should be the address to which all these servers will contact. It must be a domain with TLS 1.2 or higher. Requests should be routed to the port you specified in .env in the WEBHOOK_PORT variable.
In addition, for YooKassa to work correctly, you will need to specify a webhook url in your personal account with the following value at the end of /yookassa_payment (e.g. <https://my-awesome-webhook.example.com/yookassa_payment>) and select all values that begin with payment
